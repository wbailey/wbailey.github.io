### Recruiting

One of my favorite aspects about my job is recruiting.  I absolutely love it!  It's true.
Recruiting allows me to meet a lot of engineers and talk shop.  You  get to learn all about their
backgrounds, interests, companies they have worked for and amazing projects they have worked on.  If
you are lucky you also have an amazing technical conversation at some point that leaves everyone
impressed.  What is not to love?

Well, I don't love disappointing my team with a candidate.  We have all been there either as a
hiring manager or a member of the team.  The team is totally pumped and excited to meet whiz bang
candidate and interview them.  However, after the candidate gets past the introductory phase
everyone on the interview panel realizes they have been duped.  The candidate turns out to be a
complete dud.  We are left to wonder how they made it through the screening process and got this
far?  It sucks and neither the team or the candidate is happy about it.

In this post I am going to introduce you to candidates that I have dubbed _paper tigers_, _leaches_
and _space cadets_.  These are the candidate types who in my experience you want to avoid like the
plague.  The problem is how do we identify them and discover them early on in the process?  What
characteristics do they have in common with great candidates that make them hard to distinguish?
What questions can we ask them during a phone screen to ferret them out?

I don't have prescriptive answers for all of these questions to be honest.  I think by sharing my
experience and raising some valid points, you might be able to avoid candidates like this in the
future providing a better search experience for your team and the prospective candidates.

### Screening 101

How many times have you read a candidate's resume and thought to yourself how amazing this person is
and what a great candidate they would make for your open position?  Reviewing resumes and screening
prospective candidates is not an easy thing to do.  Resumes come in all forms and flavors making it
difficult sometimes to read whether a candidate has the relevant experience necessary for the job.
A few things that I have noticed that help in the process include the following:

* _Reject any candidate that doesn't write a personalized cover letter_ - It doesn't take that much
  effort to explain why you are interested and why your experience is right for the job then don't
  bother.
* _Favor resumes that tell a story and really emphasize what the candidate is interested in and
  passionate about_ - If people are doing it just for the money they won't make great members of
  your team.
* _Resumes that illustrate how they used their skills are better than ones that just list everything
  they have ever used_ - I dislike people who just mind numblingly list programming languages they
  have used.  You can't tell if they have only played with the language or whether they used it
  professionally
* _Forget resumes that have more than one grammatical error or spelling mistakes right away_ - I
  know this is tough for folks where English isn't their first language.  There are so many tools
  now that to me it reflects effort more than language difficulty.
* _Weed out resumes that don't contain the relevant experience or work history in them because
  stretch candidates rarely work in practice_ - This is just a no brainer to me.
* _A pet peeve of mine is resumes that are sent as Word docs instead of PDFs especially for
  technology positions_ - Send a PDF so I don't have to worry about which version of Word I have
  installed or how crappy the doc gets displayed when converted in Google Docs.

Of course there are more tips for screening but this isn't meant to be a comprehensive breakdown of
how to filter through resumes.  Years ago, Joel Spolsky wrote a nice
[piece](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/SortingResumes.html) on the subject so you can read
that for reference.

### Paper Tigers

Like the name I have given them implies, the best way to describe people who fall into this
category is that they look fantastic on paper but completely underwhelm when interviewed in person.
They either totally lack on the technical side or something else comes up where they don't impress.
Not being to totally put my finger on this person here are a few characteristics that I have noticed
about them.  Here are what you will immediately see when you read their resume:

* Their resume is easy to read and really well organized making it clear who they worked for and
  what they worked on.
* The companies they have worked for are well known for their products or development teams and it
  seems they made great contributions to either or both.
* The person has a solid educational background with degrees from well known schools and programs.
* The projects they list are relevant and have a high correlation to the position they are applying
  for.
* They perfectly meet all of the requirements for the level of experience for the position.

This all sounds great so where does it go awry?  Well this is what I have found to be true from
_paper tigers_ when I phone screen or interview them in person:

* They tailored their resume to perfectly fit the job description however they neither have the
  skills or the experience required. 
* If they are from an agency you find the recruiter just "_resume stuffed_" and the person who you
  are speaking with isn't really the person they presented on paper.
* They listed they are qualified in too many technologies, languages and frameworks when you drill
  you confirm your notion that no one person can be an expert in everything they listed.
* When you dig into their experience, you find they are part of a larger team and didn't have the
  hands on experience and had actual little involvement in the project or technology
* Another quality is listing items they haven't worked with in production but it shows up on their
  resume as if they have.
* They lie about the amount of experience and later it comes out that they have much less than they
  claimed because they claim the length of the entire project as their own vs their actual
  involvement in it.
* They did the project on their own time and have never done it professionally but count it as real
  experience on their resume.

### Leaches

The next category I have dubbed _leaches_ because like a leach, they survive off of the work of
others.  In their resumes they take credit for others but instead of being caught in the phone
screen, they pull it off and might not be exposed until you hire them.  When they join your team
they drain it just like a parasite which is bad for the team's productivity, chemistry and moral.
Some of the characteristics of this type of candidate include most everything from the _paper tiger_
and additionally:

* They led or worked with an offshore team or remote team in another location.
* They will claim to have setup or built a team but in reality they had no part in the growth at
  all.
* They indicate they selected a technology or vendor but then never worked with them or were part of
  the implementation.
* There was strong technical leadership on the team that they are trying to take credit for as their
  work and actions and involvement.
* You find out through references that this person isn't in the top half of people that person has
  worked with.
* They know just enough to be dangerous but don't have the full experience and rely on their
  teammates to actually do the work
* Beware the phantom and exaggerated titles from smaller companies that imply leadership and
  experience but when you drill in they don't have it

### Space Cadet

* this person has good experience maybe or has found a unique niche at their existing company that
  doesn't translate anywhere else
* usually really smart
* totally have freaking idea what they really want to do or how to effectively use their talents

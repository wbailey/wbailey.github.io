### Recruiting

One of my favorite aspects about my job is recruiting.  I absolutely love it!  It's true.
Recruiting allows me to meet a lot of engineers and talk shop.  What is not to love?  Engineers are
a very interesting bunch with a lot of different personalities, backgrounds and
various skill levels like I discussed in my last [post](/blog/2013/09/24/career-levels/).

Candidates at each stage in the recruiting process be it a phone screen or a in person interview
fall into two groups:

1. The Good - Qualified candidates who make it further into the process.
1. The Bad  - Candidates you need to weed out quickly and not waste time on.

In this post, I am going to focus on the bad group and alert you to a couple type you need to avoid
and the techniques to ferret them out quickly.

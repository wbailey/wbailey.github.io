## No Questions

I recently had a discussion with <a href="https://twitter.com/benkruger"
target="_blank">@benkruger</a> about interviewing and we both expressed the same frustration.
Candidates who are being interviewed will do their best to answer your questions.  It is a rare
event when you find a candidate who asks good questions back.  This led me to share the following
with Ben:

> You learn more about a candidate through the questions they ask, than the answers they give.

It is true and something that no matter what you do as a candidate you must remember.  Be prepared
ask good questions.

## When to Ask?

So if the success of your interview is determined by the questions you ask, when should you ask
them?  If you are interviewing with Ben, it will actually be the first thing that you do.  I was
surprised to learn Ben does this but the more I tought about it, I think it is a great approach.  So
as a candidate, be prepared from the moment you answer the call or step into the conference room to
ask your questions.

If you are not interviewing with Ben, and most of us are not, then I suggest incorporating your
questions into your answer.  This promotes lively discussion and turns the table on the interview
panel.  As an example, the other day I was actually being interviewed and within 5 minutes I had
them answering my questions which led to more questions from both parties.  It was great!

## What to Ask?

I can't provide for what to ask for every type of interview because that is impossible.  What I can
share is there is nothing worse from a hiring manager's perspective to be all excited about a
candidate and here them say:

> "I don't really have any other questions"

That sentence just kills it for me (so don't use it).  My view is you should always ask about the
following:

* _The Company_ - Make sure you learn everything you need to know about the company, it's vision and
  mission and if they are currently successful in fulfilling both.  Understand how you can
  contribute to both.

* _The Culture_ - This is probably number one.  You can be a great technical fit but if you are not
  a culture fit you will not be successful.

* _The Team_ - Understand the people and makeup of the team you will be joining.  Try and meet as
  many of them as possible to ask them these questions.

* _The Role_ - Be sure to confirm your understanding of the role as much as possible.  Don't just
  blindly accept the job description thinking it is similar to your current role.

* _The Successes_ - Learn from the interview panel what they have done successfully and what the
  wins are.  Struggling to share wins is usually not a good sign.

* _The Failures_ - Are they going to be transparent enough to let you know where all of the
  skeletons are buried?

*  _How they Develop_ - Try and get a good picture of how the company and team operates.  Are they
   agile? Do they pair?  Are engineers involved in discover?  Tons to be asked here!

* _How they Operate_ - Understand what operations look like.  How do they handle production support?
  What involvement in sales will you have?

* _How they Communicate_ - Sounds like a throw away question but it is really important.
  Understanding how people in the company communicate will help you determine if this position is
  for you.

Of course there are more you can ask but for my money these are the core required questions.  If you
only get through these you will have learned a lot.  I still say try and take it further and get as
detailed as possible.

## How to Ask?

A difficulty most technical people have is how to ask the questions in the first place?  You
probably have a hard enough time talking about yourself let alone turning the interview around and
asking questions.  One technique I use that has worked well is to provide your answer and tack on a
question on the end to turn it back on the interviewer.  Here is an example from an interview I had
where I was the candidate last week:

_Question_: How many teams do you manage?

_Answer_: I currently manage X cross functional teams that are made up of Product Managers,
Technical Leads, Designers, Engineers and QA.  Maybe you can tell me how that compares to how many
teams there are here and how they are organized? Who are the members of the team?

## Take the Wheel

Remember to always take an interview by the wheel and drive it both ways down the road.  Be sure to
answer the interview panel's questions thoroughly and thoughtfully.  Concurrently, make sure that
you never end up in that dead position of having no good and thoughtful questions to ask.  You kill
your chances of landing the job if you do!

> Kill it by asking great questions!

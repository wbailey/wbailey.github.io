### The Problem

Defining a Senior Software Engineer seems to be a pretty difficult task for our industry.  Managing
expectations around this definition is also really difficult and causes strife in organizations that
are trying to grow and retain talent.  The current methodology is to create a "_Job Description_"
which focuses on "_responsibilities_" and "_requirements_" by listing the work skills, technical
requirements and years of experience required for the position.

<!-- more -->

Like everyone else I used this approach for a while until I ran into problems.  I started looking
for a framework that I could use to scale an organization in both talent evaluation and career
development.  I wanted answers to questions like:

* How do you differentiate between a Software Engineer and a Senior Software Engineer?
* Is seniority based on years of experience or based on technical capability?
* How do you promote and fairly compensate engineers who use different languages and tools?
* How can you evaluate new talent consistently and compare them with the current members on your team?
* Where do the years of experience numbers come from and are they just an artificial crutch
  justification?
* How do you mentor engineers in their career and so that they can grow and learn?

There are more questions to be answered but this is a good starter set.  I turned to the web and
that yielded a couple of threads on
[programmers.stackexchange](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/14914/whats-the-difference-between-entry-level-jr-sr-developers)
and on
[Quora](http://www.quora.com/When-does-a-software-developer-become-a-senior-software-developer).
There are more posts and articles but they were not very fulfilling so I kept searching.  Not
finding what I wanted online, I talked with a few peers in my network. Turns out they use the "_Job
Description_" approach and they agree it is a failed approach.  I started looking for a framework
that I could use to scale an organization in both talent evaluation and career development.  This
search turned empty so instead of I spent a lot of time thinking on the topic and came up with a
framework that can assist in making the decisions around the questions above.

### A New Approach

It is important to understand that the definition is actually for many levels than just the Senior
Software Engineer.  There are some who argue for a "_flat_" organization but I'll address that myth
in another blog post.  We should ensure that our level definitions make it easy to answer the
questions we posited previously.  They should also help us lay the foundation for a career
progression that is possible within the company helping us retain talented people.

The challenge I set for myself which really help me free my mind was to answer the following
question:

> If you could describe what an engineer at this level will do using only word, what would it be?

Upon the single word definition being complete I would want more information so then I decided to
come up with a single sentence description containing the word to describe the role: 

> Describe what the person at this level will be doing in a sentence using the single word
> definition.

Building on the foundation the next step is to define the major areas of focus for the level:

> Define 3 to 4 technically agnostic areas of focus for the level that provide guidance for a person
> performing at this level.

It is important with the last step of the approach to not get caught up in the details of the
technical requirements.  Doing so prevents you from having an overall framework and leads to the
dreaded _Job Description_ model that we previously stated doesn't help solve any problems.

### An Example

As an example I'll walk you through how I applied the model to engineering at 
[ModCloth](http://www.modcloth.com) where we have 3 levels in the software development position:

* Associate Software Engineer
* Software Engineer
* Senior Software Engineer

Of course we have other roles on the team as well such as test and platform engineers and I am sure
you do on your team's as well, but I'll leave them out for brevity. 

#### Associate Software Engineer

This level is reserved for beginners, someone who is fresh out of school or making a career change.
We don't expect them to have a lot of experience and it is easy to envision them spending their
first year _learning_ about the languages used and best practices of their team.  Applying the model
we have the following: 

##### Description

_Learning_

##### Summary

_At the Associate level you are learning skills and developing competence._

##### Level Areas of Focus

* _Develop a basic understanding of the languages and tools used by the team._
* _Gain exposure to software development best practices such as TDD, debugging, documentation, etc._
* _Learn good communication skills to be used with your teammates._

#### Software Engineer

##### Description

_Practicing_

##### Summary

_At the Software level you are applying your skills and developing expertise_

##### Level Areas of Focus

* _Leverage best practices to write and continually improve the code base._
* _Develop mastery in the tools and languages used by the sphere._
* _Begin practicing and learning how to teach/mentor._

#### Senior Software Engineer

##### Description

_Mentoring_

##### Summary

_At the Senior level you are mentoring your teammates and sharing expertise_

##### Level Areas of Focus

* _Developing best practices to work and write on a great code base._
* _Helping evaluate and select the tools and languages used by the sphere._
* _On boarding and mentoring new engineers on the sphere._

Defining a Senior Software Engineer seems to be a pretty difficult task for our industry.  The
current methodology is to create the dreaded "Job Description" which focuses on "responsibilities"
and "requirements".  The problem with this methodology is that it doesn't provide a framework that
is consistent and technology agnostic, instead focusing on the specifics of the languages and
tools used.  This is all well and good but how do you build an organization around this approach?
How can you evaluate new talent consistently and compare it with your current team?  How do you
evaluate and compare engineers who work with different languages and tools?  Is it impossible to
compare a javascript engineer with a ruby engineer?

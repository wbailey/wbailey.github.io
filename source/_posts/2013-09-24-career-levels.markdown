### The Problem

Defining a Senior Software Engineer seems to be a pretty difficult task for our industry.  Managing
expectations around this definition is also really difficult and causes strife in organizations that
are trying to grow and retain talent.  The current methodology is to create a "_Job Description_"
which focuses on "_responsibilities_" and "_requirements_" by listing the work skills, technical
requirements and years of experience required for the position.

<!-- more -->

Like everyone else I used this approach for a while until I ran into problems.  I started looking
for a framework that I could use to scale an organization in both talent evaluation and career
development.  I wanted answers to questions like:

* How do you differentiate between a Software Engineer and a Senior Software Engineer?
* Is seniority based on years of experience or based on technical capability?
* How do you promote and fairly compensate engineers who use different languages and tools?
* How can you evaluate new talent consistently and compare them with the current members on your team?
* Where do the years of experience numbers come from and are they just an artificial crutch
  justification?
* How do you mentor engineers in their career and so that they can grow and learn?

I turned to the web and that gave me unfulfilling answers like the one on this thread on
[programmers.stackexchange](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/14914/whats-the-difference-between-entry-level-jr-sr-developers)
and this thread on
[Quora](http://www.quora.com/When-does-a-software-developer-become-a-senior-software-developer).  Of
course there are more posts and articles but they were not very fulfilling so I kept searching.
I talked with a lot of my peers in my network and they used the "_Job Description_" approach which
we already determined has failed.  Frustrated I spent a lot of time thinking on the topic and came
up with a framework that can assist in making the decisions around the questions above.

### A New Approach

The first thing to realize is that the level definition is more than about just a single level for
the _Senior Software Engineer_.  Instead it is about many different levels that are necessary for an
organization to function and thrive.  There are some who argue for a "_flat_" organization but I'll
address that myth in another blog post.  After we have defined the levels, we should ensure that our
level definitions make it easy to answer the questions we posited previously.  They should also help
us lay the foundation for a career progression that is possible within the company helping us retain
talented people.

The challenge I set for myself which really help me free my mind was to answer the following
question:

> If you could describe what an engineer at this level will do using only word, what would it be?

Upon the single word definition being complete I would want more information so then I decided upon
coming up with a single sentence description that contained the word to describe the role: 

> Describe what the person at this level will be doing using the single word definition in a
> sentence

Continuing on the theme of building up the next logical progression would be to come up with
multiple sentences that elaborate on the focus of the level and providing guidance on the detail:

> Define 3 to 4 areas of focus for the level that provide guidance for all regardless of technical
> requirements

It is important with the last step of the approach to not get caught up in the details of the
technical requirements.  Doing so prevents you from having an overall framework and leads to the
dreaded Job Description model that we previously stated doesn't help solve any problems.

### The Framework

First, let's define the levels in the engineering organization we are concerned with.  At ModCloth we
have the following:

* Principal Software Engineer
* Senior Software Engineer
* Software Engineer
* Associate Software Engineer


For an _associate_ level engineer the word that jumped out at me instantly was _learning_.

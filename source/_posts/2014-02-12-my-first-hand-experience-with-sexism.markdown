## What to do?

It's true.  I had a first hand experience with sexism that was so blatant and offensive, I didn't
know what to do in the moment.  I'll give the full details in the core of this post but for now I
want you to ask yourself, what would you do?  Would you stand up and shout?  Would you cower and
wither and just let the situation proceed?  Would you find the courage to speak up?

## Tell me the story!

I'll get right to it.  I was interviewing with a company recently who reached out to me based on my
experience in the industry.  We weren't really sure what role I would fill but after a great
conversation with the CTO I agreed to come in for an in person interview with more members of the
management team.

Long story short I was meeting with the CTO and President of the company.  The interview was pretty
standard to this point and moving along.  Basic questions and general management questions were
being discussed.  After about an hour the CTO invited the CEO to join us.  Usually a good sign at
this point that things are moving along well.

The CEO seemed nice enough when we first shook hands.  Pleasantries were exchanged and then right
out of the gate it happened.  His first question to me:

> "Do you want to know why there are no women on the management team at a company focused on women?"



I really don't know where to start with this post.  What I am going to share will be shocking and
infuriating to many.  To others it will be a very familiar experience they deal with on a daily
basis which is nothing but sad.  After much thought I have decided to share this story so that in
some way I might make a small impact and hope for this to never happen again.  It will no less and
the perpetrators will continue to be sexist and do what they did with me.

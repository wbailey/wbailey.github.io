  <p>
    I am a physicist who got the software engineering bug when I was writing FORTRAN and C code for
    molecular dynamics simulations. During my career I have learned how <i>not</i> to do many things
    from writing bad code to making mistakes managing my teams.  I write this blog to share what I
    have learned so you can avoid my mistakes.

  <h3>About Wes Bailey</h3>
  <p>
    I am a physicists who has a lot of experience writing code and leading software engineering
    teams who write better code than I ever have.  Over the years I have learned how not to do
    things so I want to share that experience here so you can learn from my mistakes.

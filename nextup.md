## Ideas for future blog posts:

* Code Ownership - When you own the code you don't complain and become a
  better engineer.  Important with legacy code that you didn't write
  yourself

* Follow Through - This is the key to being a successful manager and
  leader.  More than communication, it is important to follow up on
  commitments and team problems, issues and work being done.

* Listen vs hearing

* process vs empowerment
